# CSCA08: Introduction To Computer Science I

This repository contains all my finished (and some unfinished) code from my activity in the CSCA08 course at the University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus. In this repository are all of my assigments, exercises and practice work from the course, with documentation in context to the course projects.
All of the work in this repository was coded in Python 3.5.2 or higher.

## Assignments

The Assignments folder contains the main projects assigned for completion, aslong with the guidelines and created test files for each assignment.
The prompt for each of these assignments related to the analyzing of DNA, represented with data types and self-created objects in Python. Each assignment was completed over the course of 2-3 weeks.

## Exercises 

The Exercises Folder contains the assigned weekly homework questions, along with the guidelines and created test files for each given exercise. 
The prompts for each of these exercises allowed us to work with different types of data types and objects, and read and write files in Python. Each exercise was completed over the course of 2-3 days.

## Practice Work

The Marzieh and Harrington's Practicals folder, named after my professors for the course, contains many forms of extra code, rough work or bonus exercises given to us by the professors to help students better understand how to code in Python. 
The code in these files were used solely for learning purposes and were not graded.
