- only found start in reverse
- only found end in reverse

- only found start forwards, found both in reverse
- only found end forwards, found both in reverse
- found both forwards, found start in reverse
- found both forwards, found end in reverse

- found both forwards and backwards, forwards comes first in index
- found both forwards and backwards, backwards comes first in index
- found both forwards and backwards, same index, forwards shorter
