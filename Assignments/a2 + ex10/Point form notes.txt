GENERAL:

 - works exclusively with humans for the moment, may work with other animal 
   dna for the future.
 - humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (other animals have more/less), 
   22 are normal pairings, last is the gender pairing
 - Individual pairs of nucleotides can be found either by referring to
   their chromosome pair and location (e.g., chromosome pair 7, position 17), 
   or by their marker (e.g., rs1799883).

QUERY:
   
 - Scientists also want to be able to query an individual’s genetic sequence,
   basically asking if a certain nucleotide pattern exists, (i.e. check if gene
   with marker rs46237 is equal to 'AG'?, or check if pair 9 position 74 the
   reverse order of position 95).
   
   - To do this, scientists create special query chromosome pairs that are
     BLANK EVERYWHERE except for the pairs they wish to analyze. (They can
     use normal nucleotides (A, T, G, C) or memory nucleotides (1,2,3,4, etc.)
     
     NOTE: Memory nucleotides are just placeholders for other values
     i.e. 1 could be a memory nucleotide for B, 2 for C, etc.
     every 1 or 2 in that sequence will represent the same nucleotide
     (i.e. A1G2 is ABGC). ALL MEMORY NUCLEOTIDES ARE REPRESENTED BY A NUMBER
     BETWEEN 0 AND 9.
     
QUERY REJECTED IF:
  - a normal nucleotide in a query chromosome doesn’t equal the nucleotide
   in the chromosome being compared against
  - every memory nucleotide with the same value isn’t compared with nucleotides
   of the same value

- If a query nucleotide compares against an unknown nucleotide (i.e., the model
  simply doesn’t have any information on it) it should not cause the query to
  be rejected, except in the case where it is being compared against the male
  sex chromosome pair (23), in which case comparing a query nucleotide against
  something unknown should reject the query.
   
   
OFFSPRING:
- When two individuals mate to produce offspring, each chromosome pair of
  the offspring is filled with nucleotide pairs where one nucleotide
  comes from the mother and one comes from the father.

- These scientists have discovered a way to choose which nucleotide will
  come from each parent by building binding chromosomes that can set a given
  position or marker to be one of these two:
 - left-maternal:
    -> the child gets the mother's left nucleotide and the father’s right

 - right-maternal:
    -> the child gets the father's left nucleotide and the mother's right
